# Spot X-ray

**This screen is under development.**

The Spot X-ray work center is where selected weld positions on an assembly are x-rayed for quality verification. It ties back to the per-seam welder data captured during Round Seam Setup — when a specific seam is x-rayed, the system knows which welder made that weld.

## Planned Functionality

- Assemblies are selected for spot x-ray based on quality sampling rules.
- The inspector identifies which round seam position(s) to x-ray.
- Results are recorded and linked to the welder responsible for that seam.
- This data supports welder performance tracking and ASME compliance requirements.

## Tips

- This screen depends on Round Seam Setup being completed accurately. Ensure welders are assigned to the correct seam positions.
- Full documentation will be available when the screen is released.
