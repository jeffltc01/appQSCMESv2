# Plant Gear

View and set the current gear level for each plant (site). Each plant is displayed as a card with gear-level selector buttons and an optional Limble Location ID. Directors (Role 2.0) and above can edit gear levels and Limble IDs.

## How It Works

1. **View current gear.** Each plant card shows the plant name and the currently active gear level highlighted.
2. **Change the gear level.** Click one of the gear-level buttons on a plant card. The selection updates immediately.
3. **Set a Limble Location ID.** Edit the Limble Location ID field inline on the card and save. This links the plant to a location in the Limble CMMS system.

## Fields & Controls

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| **Plant Card** | One card per plant showing the plant name and gear controls. |
| **Gear Level Buttons** | A row of buttons representing the available gear levels. The active gear is highlighted. Click a button to change. |
| **Limble Location ID** | Optional text field linking the plant to a Limble CMMS location. Editable inline. |

## Tips

- Gear changes take effect immediately and affect production scheduling across the plant.
- The Limble Location ID is used for integration with the Limble maintenance system. If your site does not use Limble, this field can be left blank.
- Only Directors and above can change gear levels. If the buttons are disabled, check your role permissions.
